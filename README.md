# Desciption 
The repository stores data and code used in the article entitled "Analysis of small molecule mixtures by super-resolved 1H NMR spectroscopy"
- Code: contains both jupyter notebooks and matlab codes used in the spectral analysis
- NMR_Spectra: contains the experimental NMR spectra of individual molecules taken from hmdb.ca and augmented mixed specrta
- Peak_Positions: contains text files with peak positions from individual NMR spectra of the molecules
- WPT_Spectral_Analysis: contains the Approximation components obtained from the WPT decomposition of the NMR spectra
